    This is a simple school management system using python 3 and python QT5 technology tool also some other tools too. I use this project to help me
    hone my skill, To prove to myself that i'm competence enough to do a software project and make a great software product to the costumer.
    The knowledge/skill that i use or apply in this self-project come from watching offline youtube video or reading offline documentation or some random developer site.
    All of my tools that i use in this project are offline, All of them are downloaded in my android phone to my laptop, The reason i do that because i don't have a financial 
    capability to get a stable internet so to other to develope system i rely on many types of resources that is minimal to no internet require.

    I'm open to any opportunity that might come and to a social group that can give great meaningful to other people life.
